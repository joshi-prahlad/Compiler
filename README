To build do make from the directory in which this README resides which will
 generate executable named "Parser".

 Overview:
 A compiler for Java type programming language is implemented in C.
 The specification of the language is present in the file named
 Grammar. Lexical, Syntax, Semantic analysis and dead code finder
 for the programming language is built. The semantic rules are
 mentioned in the file SemanticRules.Also, the lines which will not
 be executed at run time e.g. lines following 'return' statement are
 considered dead.

 Each rule in grammar maps to one struct definition in astType.h. And
 if a non-terminal has multiple production the struct for that
 non-terminal is union of all the structs that are used to represent each rule of
 that non-terminal.
 Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) nodes are created as a side effect of reduce
 actions (in SimpleJava.y). TypeCheck.c contains dfsAST
 which traverses the tree in dfs order and calls a function(passed to
 dfsAST as a function pointer) at each node of the tree.
 The symbol table initialization and all the type check rules are
 implemented by passing different function pointers to this method,
 dfsAST.
 SymbolTable is implemented using ,uthash, an open source
 implementation of generic hash table in Java.
 To find unreachable code, intra-flow and inter-flow analysis is done by building
 control flow graphs for each of the methods defined and a call-graphs for the
 whole program. Than Depth First Search is performed on those graphs to find the
 unreachable statements.
